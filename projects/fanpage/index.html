		<p>“You felt like you were walking into history when you were there. It was a very old bar from like the late 1800s. There were the neon lights that were always on. There were stickers on top of stickers on top of stickers. And it smelled like old wood and dreams.” </br> - Jackie Luther, former bartender at CBGB</p>
