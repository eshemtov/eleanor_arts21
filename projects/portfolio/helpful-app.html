		<p>Maitre/d is an app through which users can become members to their selection of restaurants, with tiered membership options for 5 restaurants, 10 restaurants, or unlimited â€” in order to help support these businesses.<br> As benefits, they can enjoy members-only complimentary dishes and tasting menus, the chance to book cooking classes with chefs from their favorite places, and access to priority reservations at an additional fee.<br>I designed a visual identity for this app, created a logo and developed a color palette and typography system.</p>
